`std.typecons.Nullable`: Remove deprecated `alias get this`.

`Nullable` no longer implicitly converts to its member.
This feature was problematic because a simple use of a value could
invisibly cause an assertion due to type conversion.
To restore the previous behavior, replace uses of a `Nullable` value
`n` with `n.get`.
